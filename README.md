# NYU-Tandon-Bridge-Program
This program is created for students with non-technical backgrounds, flexible way for students to gain the experience needed to be admitted into select graduate programs. 
The Bridge is a single non-credit course equivalent to 400 hours of learning and more than 3 courses containing topics in Computer Programming in C++, Object Oriented Design, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, Principles of Operating Systems, and Introduction to Computer Networks.
The code shown here is that I wrote during the studying process.
